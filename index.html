RELEVANT EXPERIENCE

Freelance iOS Developer (September 2018 – Present)
Designed and developed the “Cornhole Easy Score” app for iOS and watchOS. AppStore.com/jamiemcdaniel

Big Ass Fans (July 2015 – August 2018)
Lead iOS developer for the “Haiku Home” app that controls Haiku ceiling fans, lights, and wall switches. AppStore.com/HaikuHome
Upon starting, made all changes necessary to get the app properly running on 4.7” and 5.5” iPhones. Previously it only scaled up the 4” iPhone screen. 
Performed the work required for “Haiku Home” to be a universal app – properly running on iPad (no longer a scaled up iPhone screen) in both portrait and landscape with support for Split View.
Significantly improved performance by using Instruments to identify slow code and memory issues.
Fixed all Xcode warnings.
Rewrote half of the codebase from Objective-C to Swift.
Rearchitected the app to use dependency injection for View Controllers.
Managed beta testing with TestFlight.
Monitored crash reports using Crashlytics and fixed bugs.
Implemented new features as directed by management and the UI/UX team. 
Researched Core Bluetooth framework and wrote code to control third generation Haiku products that will communicate via bluetooth.
Switched from NSLogger to Apple’s Unified Logging (introduced with iOS 10) for logging to the Console app. Used CocoaLumberjack to duplicate error log messages to a text file which would be uploaded to Crashlytics.
Simplified the Haiku device to app communication layer using Swift enums with associated values.
Communicated to our cloud server via JSON. Downloaded new firmware files and persisted them to Core Data.
Solved the problem of implementing a complicated onboarding wizard with multiple paths the user could take. I did this by subclassing UINavigationController, which was cleaner than having dozens of segues.
Managed third-party libraries with CocoaPods.
Pushed all changes to GitHub via pull requests along with a brief summary of the work that was done.
Worked through bugs, tasks, and improvement requests using YouTrack.
Explained difficult code with quality comments to benefit myself and any developer working on that code in the future.
Documented best practices and naming conventions in the repository’s README.

Freelance iOS Developer (January 2013 – July 2015)
Hired by Bananas Digital Agency to complete “What's Next”, an iPad app for AARP's Life Reimagined Initiative.
Hired by startup SightPlan, Inc. to join their team creating an app for the multifamily real estate industry.
